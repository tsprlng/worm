# Worm.hs

![](docs/illustration.gif)

This module is a library to maybe keep command-line tool users slightly happier, by whimsically illustrating progress in slow-running parallel processes with a mildly entertaining animated worm that crawls slowly from left to right and back again, while displaying textual progress from flexible sources of input.
